Pong is one of the earliest and simplest video games, created to simulate a game of table tennis.
It was first released in 1972 by Atari as an arcade game. The game is played by two players, each controlling a vertical paddle on either side of the screen.
The objective is to prevent the ball from passing your paddle while attempting to hit it past your opponent's paddle to score points.
The ball continuously moves across the screen, bouncing off the top and bottom walls. When the ball hits a player's paddle, it bounces back in the opposite direction.
Players control their paddles by moving them up and down to block the ball. If the ball passes a paddle, the other player scores a point.
The game continues until one player reaches a certain number of points
